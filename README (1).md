## üß† How It Works

### System Prompt

A well-defined **system prompt** configures the chatbot with the following responsibilities:

- Stay within the mental health domain
- Avoid diagnosis or medication suggestions
- Encourage reaching out to licensed professionals when necessary
- Use compassionate and supportive language
- Respond in the user's language (English, Urdu, or Roman Urdu)

### Conversation Memory

- `ConversationBufferMemory`: Stores the entire conversation history.
- `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`: Stores only the last 10 interactions to reduce context overflow.

### LangChain Chain

A LangChain LCEL chain is constructed using:
- System prompt
- Memory (chat + recent)
- User input
- Google Gemini model (`gemini-2.0-flash`)
- Output parsing

### Gradio Interface

The app launches a Gradio interface with:
- Chatbot window
- Textbox for input
- Buttons to send or clear messages
- Welcome message in multiple languages

---

## üí° Usage

Run the Python script:

```bash
python lang_chain(mental_health_chat_bot).py
```

Then access the Gradio interface either locally or through the public link provided after launching.
